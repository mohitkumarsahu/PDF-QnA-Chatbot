What is a Preamble?
A preamble is an introductory statement in a document that explains the document’s
philosophy and objectives.
In a Constitution, it presents the 
intention of its framers,
 the 
history behind
its creation,
 and the 
core values
 and
 principles of the nation.
The preamble basically gives idea of the following things/objects:
Source of the Constitution
Nature of Indian State
Statement of its objectives
Date of its adoption
History of the Preamble to Indian Constitution
The ideals behind the Preamble to India’s Constitution were laid down by
Jawaharlal Nehru’s Objectives Resolution,
 adopted by the Constituent
Assembly on January 22, 1947.
Although not enforceable in court, the Preamble states the objectives of the
Constitution, and acts as an aid during the interpretation of Articles when language is
found ambiguous.
Components of Preamble

source of authority
 of the Constitution lies
with the 
people of India.
Preamble declares India to be a 
sovereign, socialist, secular and democratic
republic.
The objectives stated by the Preamble are to
 secure justice, liberty, equality to

of India.
 Sovereignty means the independent authority of the State, not being
subject to the control of any other State or external power.

and support from the state.
It was incorporated in the Preamble by 42

form of Constitution which gets its authority from the will of the people expressed in

Objectives of the Indian Constitution
The Constitution is the supreme law and it helps to 
maintain integrity in the
society
 and to 
promote unity among the citizens
 to build a great nation.
The main objective of the Indian Constitution is to 
promote harmony
throughout the nation.
nd
nd
2/5The factors which help in achieving this objective are:
Justice:
 It is necessary to maintain order in society that is promised through
various provisions of 
Fundamental Rights
 and 
Directive Principles of
State Policy
 provided by the Constitution of India. It comprises three
elements, which is 
social, economic, and political.
 
Social Justice –
 Social justice means that the Constitution wants to
create a society without discrimination on any grounds like caste, creed,
gender, religion, etc.
Economic Justice –
 Economic Justice means no discrimination can be
caused by people on the basis of their wealth, income, and economic
status. Every person must be paid equally for an equal position and all
people must get opportunities to earn for their living.
Political Justice –
 Political Justice means all the people have an equal,
free and fair right without any discrimination to participate in political
opportunities.
Equality:
 The term ‘Equality’ means no section of society has any special
privileges and all the people have given equal opportunities for everything
without any discriminations. Everyone is equal before the law.
Liberty:
 The term ‘Liberty’ means freedom for the people to choose their way
of life, have political views and behavior in society. Liberty does not mean
freedom to do anything, a person can do anything but in the limit set by the
law.
Fraternity:
 The term ‘Fraternity’ means a feeling of brotherhood and an
emotional attachment with the country and all the people. Fraternity helps to
promote dignity and unity in the nation.
Importance of Objectives:
 It provides a way of life. It includes 
fraternity,
liberty,
 and 
equality
 as the notion of a happy life and which can not be taken from
each other. 
Liberty cannot be divorced from equality, equality cannot be divorced from
liberty. Nor can liberty and equality be divorced from fraternity.
Without equality, liberty would produce the supremacy of the few over the
many.
Equality without liberty would kill individual initiative.
Without fraternity, liberty would produce the supremacy of the few over the
many.
Without fraternity, liberty and equality could not become a natural course of
things.
Status of Preamble
3/5The preamble being part of the Constitution is discussed several times in the
Supreme Court. It can be understood by reading the following two cases. 
Berubari Case:
 It was used as a reference under 
Article 143(1)
 of the
Constitution which was on the implementation of the Indo-Pakistan Agreement
related to the Berubari Union and in exchanging the enclaves which were
decided for consideration by the bench consisting of eight judges.
Through the
 Berubari case
, the Court stated that ‘Preamble is the key to open
the mind of the makers’ but it can not be considered as part of the Constitution.
Therefore it is not enforceable in a court of law.
Kesavananda Bharati Case:
 In this 
case
, for the first time, a bench of 13 judges
was assembled to hear a writ petition. The Court held that:
The
 Preamble of the Constitution
 will now be considered 
as part of the
Constitution.
The Preamble is not the supreme power or source of any restriction or
prohibition but it plays an important role in the interpretation of statutes and
provisions of the Constitution.
So, it can be concluded that preamble is part of the introductory part of the
Constitution.
In the 1995 case of
 Union Government Vs LIC of India
 also, the Supreme Court
has once again held that Preamble is the integral part of the Constitution but is not
directly enforceable in a court of justice in India.
Amendment of the Preamble
42
 Amendment Act, 1976:
 After the judgment of the Kesavanand Bharati case,
it was accepted that the preamble is part of the Constitution. 
As a part of the Constitution, preamble can be amended under 
Article 368
 
of
the Constitution, but the 
basic structure
 of the preamble can not be
amended.
Because the structure of the Constitution is based on the basic elements of the
Preamble. As of now, the preamble is only amended once through the 
42
Amendment Act, 1976.
The term ‘Socialist’, ‘Secular’, and ‘Integrity’ were added to the preamble through
42
 Amendment Act, 1976.
‘Socialist’ and ‘Secular’ were added between ‘Sovereign’ and ‘Democratic’.
‘Unity of the Nation’ was changed to ‘Unity and Integrity of the Nation’.
Fact:
Article 394 of the Constitution states that Articles 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 60, 324, 367, 379 and
394 came into force since the adoption of the Constitution on 26th November 1949
and the rest of the provisions on 26
 January 1950.
